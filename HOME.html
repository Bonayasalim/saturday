    Our programs, which include both long-term and short-term courses,</p>
    are designed to equip trainees with the necessary skills and knowledge for a successful career in the electrical industry.
    We offer two key courses: the Electrical Wireman Course, focusing on electrical wiring, installation,
    and maintenance, and the Electrical Installation Course, which covers the installation, testing,
    and maintenance of electrical systems in residential, commercial,
    and industrial settings. Both courses blend theoretical knowledge with practical hands-on experience,
    preparing trainees for real-world applications.

Additionally, our programs include a 3-month industrial attachment, allowing trainees to gain valuable industry experience.
    Our courses are accredited by the National Industrial Training Authority (NITA),
    TVET Curriculum Development, Assessment and Certification Council (TVET CDACC),
    and the Madogo Vocational Training Centre internal assessment (MVTC).
